Rose, (genus Rosa), genus of some 100 species of perennial shrubs in the rose family (Rosaceae).
Roses are native primarily to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.
Many roses are cultivated for their beautiful flowers, which range in colour from white through various tones of yellow and pink to dark crimson and maroon
and most have a delightful fragrance, which varies according to the variety and to climatic conditions.
Most rose species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers being native to North America and a few to Europe and northwest Africa.
Roses from different regions of the world hybridize readily, giving rise to types that overlap the parental forms, and making it difficult to determine basic species.
Fewer than 10 species, mostly native to Asia, were involved in the crossbreeding that ultimately produced todays many types of garden roses.
Roses are erect, climbing, or trailing shrubs, the stems of which are usually copiously armed with prickles of various shapes and sizes, commonly called thorns.
